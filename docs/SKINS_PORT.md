# Chud Skins — Rust port of Rose-Remastered (design + spec)

Source: `C:\Users\geaux\League\Rose-Remastered` (Python, ~150 modules).
Target: this repo, `native/src-tauri/src/skins/` (Rust, Tauri 2) + `native/ui/` pages + bundled Pengu Loader with `CHUD-*` JS plugins.

This doc is the single source of truth for the port. Fixer agents implement against it;
deviations require updating this doc.

## 0. Scope decisions (final)

**Ported to Rust** (everything Python): config/paths/logging foundation, LCU skin features,
injection pipeline (cslol mod-tools orchestration), Pengu websocket/HTTP bridge + full message
protocol, chroma/forms/historic/random/swiftplay feature logic, phase engine, loadout ticker +
injection trigger, party mode (relay client + token codec), skin/hash downloaders.

**Stays JS (rebranded only)**: the Pengu Loader plugins — they execute inside the League
client's CEF, not our process. `ROSE-*` → `CHUD-*`.

**Rewritten in Rust**: relay worker → `workers-rs` Durable Object (`chud-party-relay`).

**Bundled unchanged**: cslol binaries (`mod-tools.exe`, `wad-extract.exe`, `wad-make.exe`),
`Pengu Loader.exe` + its DLLs. `cslol-dll.dll` is NEVER committed/distributed (DMCA) — user
supplies it; SHA-256 allowlist check ported intact (`4a00961…ad1c90` pinned set from Rose
`main/__init__.py`). `hashes.game.txt` (207 MB) is never committed — downloaded at runtime.

**Dropped (dead or superseded — confirmed by review)**:
- `analytics/` entirely (third-party tracking to `leagueunlocked.net`; machine-ID beacon. Gone.)
- `launcher/` + `updater` (Rose self-update from `Alban1911/Rose` — wrong repo even for Rose;
  Chud distributes itself). The *hash-file* updater logic survives (moved to downloads).
- STUN/UDP hole-punch (`stun_client.py`, `udp_transport.py`, `peer_connection.py`,
  `message_types.py`) — fully written but unreferenced; live path is the WS relay.
- `ChampThread` (not wired in `initialize_threads`), `SkinDownloader`/`SmartSkinDownloader`
  (superseded by `RepoDownloader`), `hashes_downloader.py` (duplicate of `hash_updater.py`,
  which is the wired one via launcher), `cslol-diag.exe` wiring, `mods_map.json`,
  `validation.validated_method`, `issue_reporter.clear_issue`, `resolution_utils.py` +
  click-catcher tables (legacy Qt-era UI detection; detection is DOM-side in plugins now),
  win32 tray/settings dialogs + console setup (replaced by Chud's Tauri tray + web UI),
  PyInstaller/_MEIPASS path branching (collapses to exe-relative resources).
- ROSE-Jade plugin ships disabled (`index.js_` upstream, i.e. already off) → rebrand but keep
  disabled; its unpinned `unpkg.com/blank-settings-utils@latest` import must be vendored if
  ever enabled.

## 1. Rebrand map (complete)

The bridge message protocol is already brand-neutral (types like `chroma-selection`,
`skin-state`) — types are kept verbatim. Only branded surfaces change, and we control both
ends (Rust server + our plugins), so renames land in lockstep.

| Analytics `api.leagueunlocked.net` | removed |

MIT attribution to the original authors (Alban & Florent, Rose contributors, CSLOL,
Pengu Loader) is PRESERVED in README/credits — license requires notice retention; the
*brand* goes, the *credit* stays.

Riot names (`LeagueClient.exe`, `League of Legends.exe`, lockfile format) are NOT branding —
never rename.

```

Integration points in existing code:
- `lib.rs`: `mod skins;` + `skins::commands()` registered; `AppState` gains
  `skins: skins::SkinsState`. Skins tool card appears in `snapshot()` tools array.
- `lcu.rs` stays the auth/base client; `lcu_ext` builds on it.
- The existing LCU WS task (`lcu_ws.rs`) gains fan-out of gameflow/champ-select events into
  `phase.rs`'s channel (one WS connection total, not two).
- Ranked kill-switch: injection honors the existing `injection_blocked` atomic.

### Threading model (the big fix)
Rose: 5+ OS threads mutating a 60-field GIL-guarded god object; documented races.
Chud: tokio tasks; ALL shared skin state in one `Mutex<SkinsShared>` (coarse first, split
later only if contention shows). Phase has exactly ONE writer (phase actor). Cross-thread
"poke booleans" become channels/watch. Generation counters stay (`AtomicU64`) for ticker and
stale-loop invalidation — same pattern lib.rs already uses.

### Magic values preserved verbatim
base skin = champion_id*1000; chroma window = base+1..+99; queue 480 + {SWIFTPLAY,BRAWL};
null-phase debounce 3 polls; LCU disconnect debounce 3; language retries 5; ticker 250 Hz
clamp 10–2000; probe 8×60 ms; GET cache TTL 0.2 s; 404/405→None contract; locale chroma
regex from skin_scraper.py ported literally; lenient semver only where still needed.

## 3. Wire/disk contracts that must not drift
1. mod-tools CLI strings (above) — character-for-character.
2. Bridge protocol: broadcast-only replies; bare `{"skin":…}` legacy message; all three port
   discovery paths (file + /bridge-port + /port); ms timestamps.
3. `historic.json` / `mod_historic.json` formats ("path:" prefix union) — kept (cheap), even
   though Chud has no Rose users to migrate.
4. Party token binary layout v2 (only the ASCII prefix changes) + relay JSON messages.
5. Select-time (not inject-time) mod extraction — the JS UI assumes it.

## 4. New crates
`axum` (bridge http+ws), `zip`, `flate2`, `sha2`, `rand`, `regex`, `junction`,
`byteorder`(or to_be_bytes), `indexmap` (skin-name map ordering), `tracing`+`tracing-appender`
(or hand-rolled slog.rs), `windows` feature adds: Win32_System_Threading, Win32_Storage_FileSystem,
Win32_System_Registry, Win32_Security. Relay worker: separate crate `relay-worker-rs` with
`worker` (workers-rs).

## 5. Milestones
Status: ALL MILESTONES COMPLETE. S1–S9 ✅ + reconciliation pass ✅ + S10 gate ✅.
Relay worker deployed + protocol-tested (`https://chud-party-relay.jivy26.workers.dev`;
old `rose-party-relay` deleted). 112 unit tests pass; `cargo build --release` clean;
whole-repo `rose` sweep clean (only docs/CREDITS attribution remain, by design).

END-TO-END PROVEN (2026-07-10, live Practice Tool run): full injection pipeline verified
against a real League client — trigger fired, resolved skin_266033 (Primordian Aatrox),
NtSuspendProcess suspended the live game (pid 26548), mkoverlay built the overlay in 1.14s,
runoverlay started, NtResumeProcess resumed cleanly. Skin visible in-game. The game-suspend
FFI (the highest-risk piece) works on a real process. Deferred-verification debt CLEARED.

Bug found + fixed during that run: injection was gated on a gameflow phase "FINALIZATION"
that never fires (FINALIZATION is a champ-select session-timer subphase, not a gameflow
phase), so the loadout ticker never armed. Fixed by triggering injection at the GameStart
phase (with an InProgress fallback + last_hover_written dedup guard) — the game monitor
suspends League on launch so the overlay builds before assets load. Works in Practice Tool
(no loadout countdown) and normal games alike. See `ticker::inject_for_game` + phase.rs.

~~Remaining functional gaps (non-blocking): custom-mod historic (path: enum), late-lock
bootstrap~~ — both closed, see "Open reconciliation items" below. Optional future polish: also
arm the loadout ticker on the champ-select session-timer FINALIZATION for earlier injection
in normal games (currently GameStart-time injection covers all modes via the game-suspend).

Open reconciliation items (from S2/S3 agent notes, address before S10):
- phase.rs: late-lock bootstrap on mid-ChampSelect start NOT ported; Swiftplay skips
  champ-select reset not honored (game-mode detect runs after reset); no distinct
  champion-exchange event (emits ChampionLocked). InjectionManager: `update_skin`
  secondary entry not ported. ~~GameMonitor auto-resume timeout defaults 60s — wire
  config `monitor_auto_resume_timeout` at InjectionManager construction.~~ DONE
  (reconciliation pass): `config::SkinsCfg::monitor_auto_resume_timeout_secs`
  (default 60.0) is now applied via `InjectionManager::set_auto_resume_timeout`
  in `lib.rs`'s `setup()`, right after construction.
- ~~`historic_skin_id: Option<i64>` can't represent the Python "path:<rel>" custom-mod
  historic value — historic-mode auto-reapply of a CUSTOM mod is not ported (only
  skin/chroma-ID historic works). Needs `historic_skin_id` → an enum in a future pass.~~
  DONE: `SkinsShared.historic_selection: Option<state::HistoricSelection>`
  (`SkinId(i64)` / `CustomMod(String)`) replaces it, with every reader/writer
  (state.rs resets, features/chroma.rs, features/random.rs, bridge/handlers.rs,
  phase.rs) updated in lockstep. `features::historic::HistoricEntry` (the
  on-disk "path:"-prefixed union, already untagged-serde) gained
  `to_selection()`/`From<&HistoricSelection>` conversions; `historic.json`'s
  format is unchanged. `ticker::resolve_injection_name`'s historic branch now
  handles `CustomMod` by extracting the base skin ID from the mod's
  `"skins/{id}/..."` path (Python's `skin_name_resolver.py` fallback chain,
  ported verbatim) — the actual mod file is picked up by
  `trigger::auto_select_historic_custom_mod`, which already re-reads
  `historic.json` independently, so both paths converge on the one custom-mod
  injection code path in `trigger.rs`. `bridge::broadcast_historic_state` now
  takes `Option<&HistoricSelection>` and reports `historicSkinId: null` +
  `historicSkinName: <path>` for a `CustomMod` (wire field NAMES unchanged).
- ~~Late-lock bootstrap: if the app starts mid-ChampSelect after the user already
  locked, the phase engine doesn't proactively fetch the session to detect the
  existing lock (only WS-fed session deltas trigger it). Port
  `lcu_monitor_thread.py::_bootstrap_late_locked_champion` in a future pass.~~
  DONE: `phase.rs::bootstrap_late_locked_champion` proactively fetches
  `/lol-champ-select/v1/session` and feeds it through the SAME
  `process_session` pipeline the WS fan-out uses (no parallel copy). Hooked in
  from `champ_select_entry` (catches "already locked when we first observe
  ChampSelect") and every 2s poll tick in `run()` (catches a lock landing
  between actor start and the first WS delta). Guarded by the extracted pure
  predicate `should_attempt_late_lock_bootstrap(phase, own_champion_locked)`
  so both call sites are a no-op once locked.

- **S1 foundation**: paths/slog/config/state/special + Cargo deps + `skins::mod` skeleton — compiles.
- **S2 LCU + phase**: lcu_ext, phase actor, ws fan-out — compiles + unit tests for map_cells/compute_locked.
- **S3 injection**: injection/* + pengu.rs lifecycle.
- **S4 bridge**: bridge/* full protocol + features/* (chroma/historic/random).
- **S5 game flow**: ticker/trigger/swiftplay.
- **S6 party**: party/* + relay worker crate.
- **S7 downloads**: repo/hashes.
- **S8 plugins**: copy + rebrand `CHUD-*` plugins, bundle Pengu Loader + tools, resources wiring.
- **S9 UI**: Skins pages in native/ui (wheel config, party, diagnostics, settings).
- **S10 gate**: zero-`rose`-grep sweep (case-insensitive, excluding upstream credits), cargo
  release build, end-to-end smoke (bridge serves, plugins connect, dry-run injection path).

## 6. Deferred / needs-Josh
- Relay deploy: `wrangler deploy` needs Josh's Cloudflare login → until then
  `CHUD_RELAY_URL` env/config; party mode is gated on it.
- Final art: Chud-branded replacements for golden_rose/flag/dice/tray imagery (interim:
  Chud icon + neutral SVGs).
- cslol-dll.dll stays untracked; Josh's local copy is referenced from the Rose checkout.
