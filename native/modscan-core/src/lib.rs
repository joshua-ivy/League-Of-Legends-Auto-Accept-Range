//! `modscan-core` — a defensive scanner for League of Legends mod archives
//! (`.fantome` files, which are just renamed `.zip`s).
//!
//! Intentionally PURE: no Tauri, no networking, no filesystem writes — it only
//! reads the bytes it's handed and reports findings. Shared between the Chud
//! app and a standalone `modscan` CLI, and trivial to unit test/fuzz in isolation.
//!
//! `scan_bytes` is the only entry point: hand it a file's bytes, get a
//! `ScanReport`. Never panics, never does unbounded work — every read is capped
//! (see `MAX_*` below), so a hostile .fantome can't DoS the scanner itself.
