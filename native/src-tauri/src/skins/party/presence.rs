//! Presence nudge (S6 follow-up): while the user is in a lobby/queue with
//! party consent accepted but party mode OFF, hold a lightweight
//! identity-free relay connection to the lobby room and, if another member
//! shows up (another Chud user with party mode on OR off), nudge them once
//! per lobby to turn party mode on. This is a SEPARATE `PartyRelay` from
//! `PartyManager`'s — that one is `None` while party mode is off, and this
//! connection must never send `join`/`skin`, so it stays identity-less even
//! when a peer's client is fully joined.
//!
//! Detects the both-off case symmetrically: every presence-only socket sends
//! `{"type":"presence"}`, which the relay just re-broadcasts the roster on
//! (`relay-worker/src/lib.rs`'s `"presence"` arm) — so two off-mode users in
//! the same lobby each see the other's socket in the member count without
//! either ever identifying themselves.
