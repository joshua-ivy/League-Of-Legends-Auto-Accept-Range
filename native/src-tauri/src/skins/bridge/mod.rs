//! Local bridge server for the in-client Pengu Loader plugins (S4) — an axum
//! server on `127.0.0.1`, port picked from the first free slot in
//! `50000..=50010` (ported from `utils\core\utilities.py::find_free_port`,
//! narrowed from Python's 100-port scan since one local server never needs
//! that many fallback attempts), written to `state_dir/bridge_port.txt` and
//! served over all three plugin discovery paths (`GET /bridge-port`,
//! `GET /port`, and the port file itself).
//!
//! `BridgeHandle` is the seam later milestones hang off of: S5 (game-flow
//! ticker/trigger) and S6 (party) hold a clone and call its
//! `broadcast_*` methods (see `broadcast.rs`) to push state to the plugins
//! without reaching into `ws.rs` themselves. It is deliberately thin —
//! `Clone + Send + Sync`, cheap to pass around — backed by a
//! `tokio::sync::broadcast::Sender<String>` fanout channel: every connected
//! plugin's WebSocket task subscribes its own `Receiver`, so "broadcast to
//! all clients" falls out of the channel's own semantics instead of manually
//! iterating a `Vec` of per-client senders. This still satisfies the
//! broadcast-only contract (`docs/SKINS_PORT.md` §3) — there is no
//! per-client targeted send anywhere in this module.
