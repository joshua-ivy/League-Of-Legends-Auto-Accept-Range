//! Game process suspend/resume monitor (ported from
//! `injection\game\game_monitor.py::GameMonitor`).
//!
//! During champion select the Riot client launches `League of Legends.exe`
//! early; this monitor suspends it the moment it appears so cslol's overlay
//! can hook file I/O before the game finishes loading assets, then resumes it
//! the instant `runoverlay` starts (see `overlay::mk_run_overlay`).
//!
//! Suspension uses the undocumented whole-process `NtSuspendProcess` /
//! `NtResumeProcess` `ntdll` exports (the safe `windows` crate exposes only
//! per-*thread* `SuspendThread`/`ResumeThread`). This is the single most
//! safety-critical operation in the app: a suspended game that never resumes
//! freezes the user's client forever, so resume is defended four ways —
//! (1) the unconditional auto-resume timeout in the watcher loop,
//! (2) `resume()`/`resume_if_suspended()`/`stop()` all resume a still-held
//! process, (3) the resume handle is stored so resuming never depends on
//! re-finding the process, and (4) a `Drop` guard resumes on teardown.
